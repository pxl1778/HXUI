***INSTALLATION***
* Download the latest release of HXUI by [clicking on this link](https://github.com/tirem/HXUI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
* Extract the download .zip file.
* Once extracted, you will have a directory called HXUI-main.  Open up this directory, and inside of it will be a directory called HXUI.
* Copy the HXUI directory to your Ashita addons folder, located at `HorizonXI\Game\addons`.
* It is recommended that you follow these steps to load HXUI by default:
    * Open up the file `default.txt` in the `HorizonXI\Game\scripts` folder.
    * Navigate to the section titled "Plugin and Addon Configurations"
    * After the `/wait 3` line, and below the block of `=======`, add the following line:
        * `/addon load hxui`
    * Save this file.  HXUI should automatically load when you start Final Fantasy XI.
* To manually load HXUI, type `/addon load HXUI` in the Final Fantasy XI client.
* To configure HXUI, type `/hxui`.

***UPDATING NOTES***
1) This addon has been recently renamed from ConsolidatedUI to HXUI. If you are upgrading from ConsolidatedUI and would like to keep your old config from before please rename the folder "consolidatedui" in game/config/addons/ to "hxui"
2) It is recommended to delete the "HXUI" folder in game/addons before upgrading to a new version as asset directories may change during development
